// Create web server
// Create a web server that listens on port 3000 and serves the comments.html file
// when someone visits http://localhost:3000/comments.

// The comments.html file should contain a form that allows users to submit comments.
// The form should have a text input field and a submit button.
// When the form is submitted, the server should save the comment to a file called comments.txt.
// Each comment should be on a new line in the file.
